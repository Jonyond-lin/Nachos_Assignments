# Nachos_Assignments
This is the repository for the lab in the Operating System Course. Our labs are based on [Nachos](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tom/nachos/).  
We are using two brunches to make sure that our 'master' brunch is always with correct results. So anyone contributing on our assignments should push their code to the 'modifications' brunch and then launch a 'Pull Request'.
If you are interested in this basic simulated OS too, please feel free to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:mengxy@stu.xmu.edu.cn).
