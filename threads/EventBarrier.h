/* EventBarrier is a synchronization mechanism which 
   allows a group of threads to wait and respond one 
   event synchronously.

   There are 2 categories of the caller of the 
   EventBarrier:
   1. EventBarier::Wait()'s caller:
   		Indicate that the caller is waiting for the
		finishing of the event.
   2. EventBarrier:::Signal()'s caller:
   		Indicate that the event has finished by the
		caller. If no waiter exists, this behavior
		will be logged.
